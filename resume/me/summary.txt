I am a Software Development Engineer at Google with over 7 years of industry experience building scalable, high-performance systems across logistics, mobility, and large-scale platform domains.
My professional journey spans product engineering at Google and Porter, where I have worked end-to-end on designing, developing, and optimizing distributed backend systems that power real-world applications used by millions. 
Outside of work, I enjoy exploring emerging technologies, contributing to developer communities, and mentoring aspiring engineers to build impactful careers in software development.
